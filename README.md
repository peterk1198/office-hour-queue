# Office Hour Priority Queue

**Background**: Most research suggests that in order for education to be successful, it needs to be equitable not
necessarily just equal. What this means is that rather than taking an approach of pure equality, where everyone is 
given the same exact resources, we ought to provide supplemental resources to those who come from
underprivileged backgrounds.
___
**Problem**: Despite leaders in education advocating for equitable education, colleges continue to support equal education.
Equal education further marginalizes unprivileged groups by making the gap between continuing college students and first-generation,
first-generation students larger. 

A common example of equal education hurting students is office hour queues.
Intuitively, students who have already had exposure to particular courses will perform better in them. In cases where
waiting any given student will only get helped once or twice in a 3-hour queue identifies clear flaws with this 
current implementation. Advanced students who might be close to completing the assignment need to wait the same amount
of time as students who may be struggling to grasp the basic concepts.

Further, there are other general flaws with office hour queues that are somewhat unrelated to equitable education such as:

**Students**: 
- Non-grouping students working on similar problems.
- No interface for students to see progress/size of queue.

**Teaching Staff**:

- No information on student's history (classes taken, grade in class, how they best learn)
- No intake of valuable data (which assignments cause the lengthiest queues, how many students are helped/hour)


___
**Objective**: We believe that if professors manages their class well, they should be acknowledged
for it, and on the flip side, if a professor runs their class poorly, they should take feedback and address it accordingly.

As such, we present making an office hour queue with "flags" that allow the professor to customize their queue to their
teaching philosophy.

Since office hours are such a vital resource to students at many universities, we present two primary ideas to make 
office hours a more equitable, enjoyable, and valuable experience. 

1. Flags to change a FCFS queue to a priority queue.
   
   These flags could consist of, and are not limited to:
   
   - Class grade based priority.
   - Class history based priority.
   - Problem set progress based priority.
   - Number of times helped based priority.
   
   Clearly, these flags are controversial. Why should someone who started early on the problem
   set be penalized for starting early? These are key points to address, which is why we simply put these flags on the
   table for the professor to create the culture in their class that they deem fit.

2. Customizable profiles.

    Office hours should be more than a place to get help. It should help you meet your peers and teaching faculty.
    We offer customizable profiles to see what people interests are, if they are frequent attendants of office hours,
    and how they think they learn best.
    
    These profiles offer valuable data to meet people who learn in similar ways and who have similar interests. Having
    a picture connected to accounts can also help teaching staff to more easily identify students and create a more
    personal connection.
